                <p>Welcome to PHP Class Spring 2018!<br>
                </p>
                <p>This class brings with it my return to adjuct teaching. From 2006-2012 I taught evening classes, at FVTC, in Web Design. My days are spent working at J. J. Keller as a UI/UX Design Analyst. My design team designs for the company's flagship websites. We collaborate with various departments and use the SCRUM methodology. The way websites are built has changed  exponentially
                    within the past 3-5 years that it sometimes makes my head spin.  We've come from building sites with table tags to divs to the 12-column flexible grid
                    system using frameworks, such as Twitter's Bootstrap and Google's Material design, to now using SVG
                    images, Flexbox, and CSS Grids! I also build in Wordpress.</p>
                <p>My love for learning has recently brought me into the server-side world. I have experience with Visual Studio Code, jQuery, &amp; PHP. I look forward to learning from you this semester, as well! We all have a little something different to offer &amp; together we make the IT world stronger. Coding is not done in a bubble, it takes a team. </p>
